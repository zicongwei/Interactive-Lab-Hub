# IDD-Fa18-Lab1: Blink!

**A lab report by Irene Wei. Student**

## Part A. Set Up a Breadboard

## Part B. Manually Blink a LED

**a. What color stripes are on a 100 Ohm resistor?**  

Brown, Black, Brown, Gold
 
**b. What do you have to do to light your LED?**  

Set up the circuit following the diagram, and plug the micro controler to laptop's usb to give its power, and press the button to light the LED.

## Part C. Blink a LED using Arduino

### 1. Blink the on-board LED

**a. What line(s) of code do you need to change to make the LED blink (like, at all)?**  

Nothing needs to change from the example codes of blink.

**b. What line(s) of code do you need to change to change the rate of blinking?**  

change the value in delay() function

**c. What circuit element would you want to add to protect the board and external LED?**  

Add resistors to protect the board and the external LED.
 
**d. At what delay can you no longer *perceive* the LED blinking? How can you prove to yourself that it is, in fact, still blinking?**  

After tried multiple delay values, I can nologer perceive the LED blinking at 10ms. I can prove it is in fact blinking by using my phone camera to record it, since it has different frame rate.

**e. Modify the code to make your LED blink your way. Save your new blink code to your lab 1 repository, with a link on the README.md.**

### 2. Blink your LED

**Make a video of your LED blinking, and add it to your lab submission.**

## Part D. Manually fade an LED

**a. Are you able to get the LED to glow the whole turning range of the potentiometer? Why or why not?**  

Yes. I am able to get the LED to glwo the whole turning range of the potentiometer. As the resistence goes bigger, the voltage becomes smaller, so it will becomes dimmer. 

## Part E. Fade an LED using Arduino

**a. What do you have to modify to make the code control the circuit you've built on your breadboard?**

change the pin numnber (led) to 11

**b. What is analogWrite()? How is that different than digitalWrite()?**

digitalWrite() sets the pin to one of two states - HIGH and LOW, which are 5V and ground respectively.  
analogWrite() sets the value of a PWM output pin. It is on a scale of 0 - 255, such that analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty cycle (always on), and analogWrite(127) is a 50% duty cycle (on half the time).

## Part F. FRANKENLIGHT!!!

### 1. Take apart your electronic device, and draw a schematic of what is inside.

**a. Is there computation in your device? Where is it? What do you think is happening inside the "computer?"**  

Yes. It computes how much people's hands move in which directionï¼Œwith the use of photoelectric sensor. 

**b. Are there sensors on your device? How do they work? How is the sensed information conveyed to other portions of the device?**  

Yes. It uses photoelectric sensor. When it sensed a change in movement, in the circuit, the lights will turn on to notify this change in distance, and the information will be computed back to the computer. 

**c. How is the device powered? Is there any transformation or regulation of the power? How is that done? What voltages are used throughout the system?**  

It uses battery. There is no transformation or regulation of the power. The voltages throughout the system is 3V.

**d. Is information stored in your device? Where? How?**
No.

### 2. Using your schematic, figure out where a good point would be to hijack your device and implant an LED.

To hijack my device, I basically put the wires of my breadboard on both the positive and negative side of the device. With the switch on, the LED lights. 

### 3. Build your light!

**Make a video showing off your Frankenlight.**
